### Download all programs by running this in your terminal:

```
   git clone https://github.com/Ali1raz/DSA-in-cpp.git DSA_cpp
```

The OOP concepts used are:

1. Classes
2. Objects
3. Constructors
4. Member Variables
5. Member Functions
6. Pointers
7. Dynamic Memory Allocation
8. Encapsulation
9. Abstraction

## Data Structures:

> Data structures are a way to organizing and storing data in computer, so that it can be efficiently accessed, processed and manipulated. They provide a logical and efficient modal for organizing data elements and enable effective use, persistence and sharing of data.

### There are various types of Data structures, including:

1. Linear data structures:
   - Arrays
   - Linked lists
     - [Single Linked Lists](./SLL/SLL.cpp)
     - [Double Linked Lists](./DLL/DLL.cpp)
     - Circular Linked Lists
       - [Circular singly linked lists](./CSLL/CSLL.cpp)
       - [Circular Doubly linked lists](./CDLL/CDLL.cpp)
   - [Queue](./Queue/)
   - [Stack](./Stack/)
2. Non-linear data structures:
   - [Trees](./Non-Linear-ds/TREE/)
   - [Graphs](./Non-Linear-ds/GRAPH/)

## Algorithms:

> Algorithms are step-by-step procedure to solve a problem efficiently and effectively. It's like a recipe for computer!
